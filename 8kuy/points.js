// 😱 DESCRIPTIONS

// Our football team has finished the championship.

// Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

// For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

// Points are awarded for each match as follows:

// if x > y: 3 points (win)
// if x < y: 0 points (loss)
// if x = y: 1 point (tie)
// We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

// Notes:

// our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
// 0 <= x <= 4
// 0 <= y <= 4

// 🐱‍👤 TESTS
// assert.strictEqual(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:0","2:1","3:1","4:1","3:2","4:2","4:3"]) , 30);
//     assert.strictEqual(points(["1:1","2:2","3:3","4:4","2:2","3:3","4:4","3:3","4:4","4:4"]) , 10);
//     assert.strictEqual(points(["0:1","0:2","0:3","0:4","1:2","1:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 0);
//     assert.strictEqual(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:0","2:1","1:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 15);
//     assert.strictEqual(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:4","2:2","3:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 12);
//   });


// ✔ SOLUTION

// my solution

function points(games) {
  let totalPoints = 0; // Initialize total points to 0

  // Iterate through each match result
  games.forEach(game => {
      const [x, y] = game.split(':').map(Number); // Split the score and convert to numbers
      
      // Calculate points based on the match result
      if (x > y) {
          totalPoints += 3; // Win
      } else if (x < y) {
          totalPoints += 0; // Loss
      } else {
          totalPoints += 1; // Tie
      }
  });

  return totalPoints; // Return the total points
}
 

console.log(points(["1:0", "2:0", "3:0", "4:0", "2:1", "3:1", "4:1", "3:2", "4:2", "4:3"]));


//Best Practices
// const points=games=>games.reduce((output,current)=>{
//   return output += current[0]>current[2] ? 3 : current[0]===current[2] ? 1 : 0;
// },0)
